## Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of this project was to analyze several sources of employee data from Packard-Hewitt and determine as they look toward to succession planning.  We will be looking at the number of retiring employees by their title and see where potential gaps exist and where that may be filled by looking at mentorship opportunities within the company.  This will help the company determine if the voids that are left by retiring employees can be filled with external candidates or if the company should look outside the current employee base.

## Summary

In summary using a combination of python scripting and api's we were able to demonstrate a way for users to pick travel destinations based on temperature requirements.  This required pulling latitude and longitudes and getting wether information from weather data apis then plotting them using a google api. -->
