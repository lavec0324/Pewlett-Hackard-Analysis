# Pewlett-Hackard
Module 7

## Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of this project was to analyze several sources of employee data from Pewlett-Hackard and determine as they look toward to succession planning.  We will be looking at the number of retiring employees by their title and see where potential gaps exist and where that may be filled by looking at mentorship opportunities within the company.  This may help the company determine if the voids that are left by retiring employees can be filled by training within the company.

## Results

From the tables below we can see:

* PH has a disproportionate population of senior personnel retiring which includes engineers and staff
* There is a very small population of managers retiring
* Overall numbers of mentors is small relative to the retiring staff which would be an issue as even with one person have several mentorees they would still not be able to cover the retiring population
* That disproportion gets even greater when looking at the senior engineers, where potential mentors are outnumbered by retirees by over 150 to 1

** Test
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Two additional queries could include:
